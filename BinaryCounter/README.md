# About
The .ino code above displays the binary representation of numbers from 0 to 15 using 4 LEDs.
To run this code, the user must have an Arduino Uno, the Arduino IDE, 4 LEDs, 4 330 ohm resistors, wires and a bread board. Refer to LED_Schematic.png for the schematic.
Project inspired by Paul McWhorter.
